This is a story of a Squirrel.  His name was Steve.   It was the best of times and the worst of times. This squirrel was a major entrepenuer.  He worked realy hard to store many nuts upfor winter. He was so good at it that he would sell his extra nuts to other squirrels and eventualy people.   This made him the richest
squirrel in the state.   But he had enough so he did...

He wanted to make more friends. One day, he met a beautiful cat, Kitty. They became friends soon. He gave her many nuts to eat, but Kitty did not like nuts, she liked fish.

"But where I can get fish?" Steve wondering. He decided to try his luck in the river and he built a trap to catch fish. However, fish are much smarter than he though, after a whole week, his "awesome" trap didn't help him catch any fish. He felt desperate and suddenly, a idea came to his mind...

"I could learn how to use black magic!", Steve excitedly thought to himself. He went on a journey in search of a witch rumored to be close to the giant tree of life in the center of the forest. Steve met the witch but the witch declined his offer. Sad that he could not learn black magic, he went and found a human diver. He kindly asks the diver to help him out and viola!, Fishes everywhere. He brought them back to Kitty and enjoyed the fish together.
