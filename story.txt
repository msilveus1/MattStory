This is a story of a Squirrel.  His name was Steve.   It was the best of times and the worst of times. This squirrel was a major entrepenuer.  He worked realy hard to store many nuts upfor winter. He was so good at it that he would sell his extra nuts to other squirrels and eventualy people.   This made him the richest
squirrel in the state.   But he had enough so he did...
